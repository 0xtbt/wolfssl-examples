Disclaimer
---------------------------------------------------------
These have currently been tested in windows CCS only. Once testing on the linux distribution for CCS is complete
this README will be updated.

Setting up the file system
---------------------------------------------------------
Clone the entire "tirtos_ccs_examples" folder into your <cyassl_root>/tirtos directory.
You should now have <cyassl_root>/tirtos/tirtos_ccs_examples.

Instructions for building CyaSSL application for TI-RTOS
---------------------------------------------------------

Installing the software
-----------------------
1. Install the NDK product ndk 2.24.00.05 in C:/ti
2. Open CCS. A prompt opens asking to install discovered product. Select the ndk product and click finish. 
Restart if prompted.
3. In CCS, open View -> CCS App Center. Search "ti-rtos". Select "TI-RTOS for TivaC" from the results and click 
Install Software. Follow the instructions.


Building CyaSSL libraries for TI-RTOS
-------------------------------------
1. Replace tirtos.mak in C:\ti\tirtos_tivac_2_00_02_36 with the tirtos.mak in this repository. 
Open the tirtos.mak and set CYASSL_INSTALLATION_DIR variable to the correct CyaSSL installation path.
2. Open a command prompt. CD into C:\ti\tirtos_tivac_2_00_02_36.
3. Run the make command to build CyaSSL libaries.
    
   ..\xdctools_3_30_01_25_core\gmake.exe -f tirtos.mak cyassl

Running CyaSSL CTaoCrypt benchmark and test application.
--------------------------------------------------------
1. After running the TCP Echo Server application, in the Debugger View, open Run -> Load Program. 
Browse to the Benchmark application (C:\cyassl\tirtos\packages\ti\net\cyassl\tests\ctaocrypt\benchmark). 
Select benchmark.xem4f and Click Open and Click OK to load the application.
2. Test by running the application.
3. Repeat the steps 1 and 2 for Test application (C:\cyassl\tirtos\packages\ti\net\cyassl\tests\ctaocrypt\test).

Getting Optimal Results for the benchmarks
--------------------------------------------------------
The example included in this repository has all the correct optimization settings and will re-build the relevant
c files at compile time. In CCS go to the Project tab. Click "Import CCS Projects..."
Click "Browse..." and navigate to <cyassl_root>/tirtos/tirtos_ccs_examples/ and click "OK". In the "Discovered projects"
window you will see all CCS projects. Check the ones you would like to import into the workspace and click "Finish".
Build and debug the benchmark project to see Optimal results and additional benchmarks for camellia, rabbit, chacha, 
poly1305, sha512, and ECC.
