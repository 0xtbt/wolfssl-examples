wolfSSL SSL/TLS Examples
========================

Here are examples focused on TCP/IP connections. The simplest of which are the
`*-tcp.c` files, which demonstrate a simple client/server TCP/IP connection
without encryption. From there, the `*-tls.c` files demonstrate the same
connection, but modified to utilize wolfSSL to establish a TLS 1.2 connection.

In general, the naming convention of these files mean that if a file is named
in the form `X-Y.c`, then it's a copy of `X.c` intended to demonstrate Y. The
exceptions being `server-tls.c` and `client-tls.c`, as noted above.
Furthermore, the files is formated such that using a diff tool such as
`vimdiff` to compare `X-Y.c` to `X.c` should highlight only the relevant
changes required to convert `X.c` into `X-Y.c`

The files in this directory are presented to you in hopes that they are useful,
especially as a basic starting point. It is fully recognized that these
examples are neither the most sophisticated nor robust. Instead, these examples
are intended to be easy to follow and clear in demonstrating the basic
procedure. It cannot be guaranteed that these programs will will be free of
memory leaks, especially in error conditions.
